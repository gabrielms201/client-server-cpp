# ❱ About
I've made this repository in order to improve my skills with **client/server** application as well as my **cmake**, **c++** and **Boost** skills
What you will need to build this project:
# ❱ Build Windows
> -[Lib Boost v1.72](https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.72.0/boost_1_72_0-msvc-14.1-64.exe/download)  
> -[CMake (at least VERSION 3.8)](https://cmake.org/download/)
> -[Visual Studio 2019 Community + Toolset v141](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/pt-br/downloads/)
 
Once you have these dependencies, just run the **bootstrap.bat** and we're good to go
# ❱ Build Linux
